Analysis of Stocks

## **Overview of Project**
  We are refactoring some code given to us from Steve in relation to Stock data from 2017 and 2018 so we can see the total volume, starting price, ending price, and whether the stock appreciated or depreciated.
  
## Results
  We were able to refactor the code to visualize the stock information from 2017 and 2018 by assigning the proper data type to our iterators along with adding a loops to get to proper values. The code is succesfully runned with an input box as well as a timer that illlustrates how long it took to run the code which I have illustrated below. The first image is for 2017 and the second image is for 2018.

## Summary
  This is my first foray into refactoring but I can see some advantages and disadvantages to it. An advantage in refactoring is that much of the code has been given to you so we just have to visualize the rest and make sure it is executable. There is also a downside to refactoring code that was given in that it can cause confusion because we are picking up code that has been somewhat written. We potentially need to reformat along with figuring out what code to add.
  Advantages of the original script are that we get to write the code from beginning to end so the style comes out the way we want it to so long as the code is executable. An obvious disadvantage is that it could take longer to write the whole code.
